# eslint/no-fallthrough Pedantic [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#eslint-no-fallthrough)

🚧 An auto-fix is planned for this rule, but not implemented at this time.

### What it does [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#what-it-does)

Disallow fallthrough of `case` statements

This rule is aimed at eliminating unintentional fallthrough of one case to the other. As such, it flags any fallthrough scenarios that are not marked by a comment.

### Why is this bad? [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#why-is-this-bad)

The switch statement in JavaScript is one of the more error-prone constructs of the language thanks in part to the ability to “fall through” from one case to the next. For example:

js

```
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();

  case 2:
    doSomethingElse();
}
```

In this example, if `foo` is `1`, then execution will flow through both cases, as the first falls through to the second. You can prevent this by using `break`, as in this example:

js

```
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
    break;

  case 2:
    doSomethingElse();
}
```

That works fine when you don’t want a fallthrough, but what if the fallthrough is intentional, there is no way to indicate that in the language. It’s considered a best practice to always indicate when a fallthrough is intentional using a comment which matches the `/falls?\s?through/i`` regular expression but isn’t a directive:

js

```
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
  // falls through

  case 2:
    doSomethingElse();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
  // fall through

  case 2:
    doSomethingElse();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
  // fallsthrough

  case 2:
    doSomethingElse();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1: {
    doSomething();
    // falls through
  }

  case 2: {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
}
```

In this example, there is no confusion as to the expected behavior. It is clear that the first case is meant to fall through to the second case.

### Examples [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#examples)

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

js

```
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();

  case 2:
    doSomething();
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

js

```
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
    break;

  case 2:
    doSomething();
}

function bar(foo) {
  switch (foo) {
    case 1:
      doSomething();
      return;

    case 2:
      doSomething();
  }
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
    throw new Error("Boo!");

  case 2:
    doSomething();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    doSomething();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    doSomething();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
  // falls through

  case 2:
    doSomething();
}

switch (foo) {
  case 1: {
    doSomething();
    // falls through
  }

  case 2: {
    doSomethingElse();
  }
}
```

Note that the last case statement in these examples does not cause a warning because there is nothing to fall through into.

## Configuration [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#configuration)

Whether to allow empty case clauses to fall through.

### commentPattern [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#commentpattern)

type: `string | null`

Custom regex pattern to match fallthrough comments.

### reportUnusedFallthroughComment [​](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/eslint/no-fallthrough.html#reportunusedfallthroughcomment)
